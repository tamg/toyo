* **Toyo** is a chrome extension that allows you to send links to yourself with one click ðŸ˜Ž!
* Whenever you find something interesting right click on the webpage and click "Email Me Yo!" as shown below:
* <img src="/png/screenshot.png" alt="alt text" width="600">
* Then a tab opens automatically and sends you the email and closes automatically. Since the email tab opens and doesn't become the active tab, you can just ignore it. If you have selected text on the webpage the selected text is sent as part of the email.
